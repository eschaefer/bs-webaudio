# ReasonML WebAudio API bindings

An ongoing effort to add the [WebAudio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#audioapi) bindings to ReasonML.

End-goal is to merge these into [reasonml-community/bs-webapi-incubator](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-webapi-incubator).

It's a big undertaking, but if it could be [done for TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator/blob/master/baselines/dom.generated.d.ts), it can be done for Reason.
